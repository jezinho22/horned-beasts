Actual time needed to complete: <span style="color:#ccff00">Lost track of time
and forgot to break down into any steps. Whole thing took two hours, with
mini-breaks eg to check in with co-learners. It was way harder than yesterday
because it was so hard to form tasks into a sequence - partly because there was
less support from the lab notes but also because the steps can be done in so
many orders, and very much because in order to build it you need to build and
test, build and test, which means breaking down into steps that allow the code
to be tested, which requires a full understanding and manipulation of the whole
process. I found that hard, having only just learned it.</span>
